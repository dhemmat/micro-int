# Micro-int

Micro-Int is a very basic rails app for micro coding interviews. You can use this when you would like to send a candidate a coding test as a screener before the real interview. 

## Usage

### Creating questions
Head to the root of your application. You will be prompted to create an interview question. The only required field is the question text, the rest can be filled in by the candidate at a later time. 

### Taking the micro interview
Once the question is created, simply share the interview link displayed with the candidate and ask him to complete it and submit it. He will only be able to submit it once, the interview question will be permanently locked after it is correctly submitted. The candidate will need to fill all the fields to submit the interview

### Reviewing the interview
Once a candidate completes a micro-interview, the link to the interview will now redirect to the results. You can use the results link displayed to share the results with other team members.
